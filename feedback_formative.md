- [ ] Make changes to your code from weeks 3 to 5 according to the feedback below. This will form part of your summative assessment. (You may use the checkboxes to keep track of your progress) 


## Feedback:

### Feedback Week 3:
The code for week 3 is great. There is no need to change anything.


### Feedback Week 4:
- [ ] The answer to what the mystery code does is quite vague. Does it select all the prime numbers? Where does it select them from?
- [ ] The maths in file powersof2.py is correct, but if a user just replaces the random number draw with the line n=1750, it does not work, because python expects a string. I don't understand, why you draw a random integer, convert it to string, and then convert it back to an integer again. It seems overly complicated and makes the code less robust to changes. It is possible that the solutions in the other files called something with powersof2 are correct, but I only looked in this one. It should not be up to the user to search for the file with the correct solution!
 

### Feedback Week 5:
The code for week 5 is great. There is no need to change anything.
