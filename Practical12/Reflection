I learnt to use //.

In SIR_vaccination model, I noticed the infected decreased too quickly as the vaccination rate increase.. 
I later found it was because assigned the value to S outside the vaccination rates loop. 
So when the loop began, S still had the value assigned to it at the end of the last loop.
Then I assigned a new value to S at the beginning of the vaccination rates loop.

I learned to use axes.

I completed Spatial_SIR_vac model by adding a vaccinated rate (V) and random transformation of 0 to 3.
vac = np.random.choice(range(10000), int(10000*V), replace=False)
for v in vac:
    population[v//100][v%100] = 3

I am trying to produce an GIF with the Spatial_SIR model.
update: I made a 100-frame gif with matplotlib.animation
