Feedback Week 13

There is code to allow the user to input parameters or set random parameters and to keep track of those choices and run the model. But there is no actual change being made to the xml file, so the model being run will always be the same as the original xml file. (This can be seen when choosing option C and running several simulations with different random numbers: prey max and predator max always come out as the same, which is actually highly unlikely.)

Nice touch to give users 3 different options as to how to run the model
 
15 
Very nice format with the A, B, C choices!
